# Steps


1. Upgrade to the latest version of the corresponding module. For example, if you use A7670G, use the upgrade package of A7670G. If you use A7670SA, use the upgrade package of A7670SA. The same method applies to other models, because the capture log requires the use of the TxDB.txt file in the firmware package. Please watch the [upgrade video here](https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-A76XX/blob/main/docs/update_fw.md)

2. After the upgrade is complete, start log capture and grab the running log

3. [Download Log Capture Recorder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/115qZ_0FeM-abigEliNge3JbYbbcAuR2x?usp=sharing)

4. Run your problem step and the logger will save all the records

5. Save the log export and send it to us
